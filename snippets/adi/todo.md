# Todo
- Figure out how to find the correct PSK-decoded values the sending and receiving isn't aligned for the PSK
    - You don't have a reference for "zero degree phase shift". Phase-shift is correct but you need to do some kind-of syncing to actually know your base phase-shift.
- Try going one step upstream and using the iio libraries directly
- Then check how the iio libraries interact with the drivers
- Check where the FPGA comes in between / where it is used

- Recalibrate the pluto-frequency with satellite data: https://community.libre.space/t/correcting-frequency-offset-on-adalm-plutosdr/10717/3
