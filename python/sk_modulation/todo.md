# Todo
- Figure out why the sending and receiving isn't aligned
- Do the necessary calibrations / adaptations to make sure they are aligned
- Try increasing the bandwidth, measuring and saving on the pluto, and then getting it from the pluto: https://ez.analog.com/adieducation/university-program/f/q-a/571424/adalm-pluto-fill-up-buffer-using-the-maximum-sampling-rate-and-read-it-after

- Recalibrate the pluto-frequency with satellite data: https://community.libre.space/t/correcting-frequency-offset-on-adalm-plutosdr/10717/3
- Try sending and receiving a sine, and check the receiving frequency spectrum
