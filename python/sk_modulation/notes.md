# Frequency alignemnt between TX and RX

- TX1, TX2 share the same LO, and always operate at the same frequencies
- RX1, RX2 share the same LO, and always operate at the same frequencies

There is 
- a single clock (LO)
- 2 synthesisers, which get their clock input from the single LO.
- a baseband PLL synthesiser for baseband clock signal generation.
